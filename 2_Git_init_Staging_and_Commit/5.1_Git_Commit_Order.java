You're on the right track with the basic Git workflow, but there's no need to run `git init` again after the initial repository setup. Here's the corrected workflow:

1. **Create Your Project**:
   - Start by creating your project directory and adding all the files and directories you need for your project.

2. **Initialize a Git Repository**:
   - Navigate to your project directory in the terminal and use `git init` once to initialize a Git repository for that project. This only needs to be done once at the beginning.

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   git init
   ```

3. **Stage Your Changes**:
   - Use `git add` to stage the changes you want to include in your next commit. You can stage specific files or directories.

   ```bash
   git add file1 file2       # Stage specific files
   git add directory_name   # Stage a directory and its contents
   ```

4. **Commit Your Changes**:
   - After staging your changes, commit them with `git commit` along with a commit message to create a new snapshot.

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Your commit message here"
   ```

5. **Repeat for Subsequent Commits**:
   - If you make further changes to your project, simply repeat steps 3 and 4 by staging and committing those changes.

   ```bash
   # Stage changes
   git add file3 file4
   git add another_directory

   # Commit changes
   git commit -m "Second version of project"
   ```

Each commit you make is a snapshot of the project at that moment, capturing the changes you've staged. Git tracks the entire history of your project, so you don't need to reinitialize the repository with `git init` after the initial setup. Subsequent commits build upon the previous ones, and you can access any previous version of your project using Git's version control features.

To access earlier versions of your project, you can use Git commands like `git log`, `git checkout`, and `git reset` to view the history and switch between different snapshots (commits) in your repository. You don't need to create a new repository for each version; Git keeps track of the changes and allows you to navigate through them efficiently.
