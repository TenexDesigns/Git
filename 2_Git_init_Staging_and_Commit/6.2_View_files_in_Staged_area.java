Removing Files from Git Staging Area

To remove files from the Git staging area without deleting them from your working directory, you can use the git rm --cached command followed by the file or directory name git-scm.com.

For example, to remove a directory named bin and its contents from the staging area, you would run:

git rm --cached bin/ -r

5. **Viewing Files and Folders in the Staged Area**:

   To list the files and folders currently in the staging area (i.e., the files that are ready to be committed), you can use the `git ls-files` command:

   ```bash
   git ls-files
   ```

   This command will display a list of all the files that have been staged for the next commit.
