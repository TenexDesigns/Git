The correct order is as follows:

1. Make your project.
2. Initialize a Git repository in the project directory using `git init`.
3. Stage the files in your project using `git add`.
4. Commit the staged changes using `git commit`.

If you make changes to your project after you have committed, you can simply stage the modified files and commit them again. You do not need to reinitialize the Git repository.

Here is an example:

```
# Initialize a new Git repository
git init

# Create a book project directory
mkdir bookProject

# Move into the book project directory
cd bookProject

# Create a new file called README.md
echo "This is the book project README file." > README.md

# Stage the README.md file
git add README.md

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Add README.md file"

# Make some changes to the README.md file
echo "This is an updated version of the book project README file." > README.md

# Stage the modified README.md file
git add README.md

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Update README.md file"
```

Now you have two commits in your Git repository. The first commit is a snapshot of your project when you first created it. The second commit is a snapshot of your project after you made changes to the README.md file.

You can use the `git log` command to view the history of your repository.

```
# View the history of the repository
git log
```

This will show you a list of all of the commits that have been made to the repository. You can click on a commit to view the changes that were made in that commit.

You can also use the `git checkout` command to revert to a previous version of your project. For example, to revert to the first version of your project, you would use the following command:

```
# Revert to the first version of the project
git checkout HEAD~1
```

This will restore your project to the exact state it was in when you made the first commit.

Git is a powerful tool that can help you to track the changes to your project and manage your project history. I hope this helps!
