In Git, you can indeed add and track both files and directories. Git tracks changes in all files and directories that you add to the repository. Here's how you can work with directories in Git:

1. **Adding Directories**:
   - To add an entire directory (including all its files and subdirectories) to the staging area, you can use the `git add` command with the directory's path.

   ```bash
   git add directory_name
   ```

   For example, if you have a directory named "my_folder," you can add it like this:

   ```bash
   git add my_folder
   ```

   This command stages all the changes in "my_folder" for the next commit.

2. **Tracking Changes in Directories**:
   - Once you've added a directory to the staging area and commit it, Git will track changes in that directory and its contents.
   - Any modifications, additions, or deletions made to files within the directory or its subdirectories will be tracked by Git.

3. **Adding Individual Files**:
   - You can add individual files within a directory by specifying the file path.

   ```bash
   git add directory_name/file_name
   ```

   For example:

   ```bash
   git add my_folder/file.txt
   ```

   This command stages only the specified file for the next commit.

4. **Adding All Changes Recursively**:
   - To add all changes (including new files and modifications) in the current directory and its subdirectories, you can use the `git add` command with the `-A` or `--all` option.

   ```bash
   git add -A
   ```

   This will stage all changes in the current directory and its subdirectories.

5. **Adding All Changes Non-Recursively**:
   - To add all changes in the current directory only (excluding subdirectories), you can use the `git add` command with the `-u` or `--update` option.

   ```bash
   git add -u
   ```

   This stages changes in the current directory but not in subdirectories.

Remember that once you add a file or directory to the staging area, it will be part of the next commit. Git will track changes in all the files and directories that have been added. You don't need to add every file in every directory individually; you can use the appropriate commands to add changes in bulk or selectively as needed.
