Yes, you can add directories to Git. To add a directory, you can use the `git add` command with the directory name. For example, to add a directory called `src`, you would use the following command:

```
git add src
```

Git will track all of the files in the directory, including any subdirectories. You can also use the `git add -A` command to add all of the files in the current directory and its subdirectories.

Git tracks changes to all of the files and directories that you have added to the repository. This means that you can revert to previous versions of your project if necessary.

You can add both files and directories to Git. However, you do not need to add every file in every directory. You can only add the files that you want to track.

Here is an example of how to add a directory to Git:

```
# Initialize a new Git repository
git init

# Create a directory called src
mkdir src

# Add the src directory to Git
git add src

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Add src directory"
```

You can now view the history of your repository by running the `git log` command.

```
# View the history of the repository
git log
```

This will show you a list of all of the commits that have been made to the repository. You can click on a commit to view the changes that were made in that commit.

I hope this helps!
