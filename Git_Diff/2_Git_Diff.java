The `git diff --staged` command shows the changes that have been staged for the next commit. It is useful for seeing what changes will be included in the next commit before you actually make the commit.

The output of the `git diff --staged` command is in the following format:

```
diff --git a/<file_name> b/<file_name>
index <old_hash>..<new_hash>
<diff_output>
```

The `<file_name>` placeholder is the name of the file that has changed. The `<old_hash>` and `<new_hash>` placeholders are the SHA-1 hashes of the file before and after the changes were made. The `<diff_output>` placeholder is the diff output, which shows the changes that were made to the file.

Here is an example of the output of the `git diff --staged` command:

```
diff --git a/kim.js b/kim.js
index 0000000..e69de29
diff --git a/main.txt b/main.txt
index 479c6bc..40fc635 100644
--- a/main.txt
+++ b/main.txt
@@ -1 +1,2 @@
-hello George Gacau
\ No newline at end of file
+hello George Gacau and Eliud
+Go back to schooolsÂ 
\ No newline at end of file
```

This output shows that two files have been staged for the next commit: `kim.js` and `main.txt`. The `kim.js` file has been completely rewritten, and the `main.txt` file has had a line added to it.

The `git diff` command shows the changes between the working directory and the HEAD commit. It is useful for seeing what changes have been made to your files since the last commit.

The output of the `git diff` command is in the same format as the output of the `git diff --staged` command.

The `git status -s` command shows a summary of the changes in the working directory and the staging area. It is useful for getting a quick overview of the state of your repository.

The output of the `git status -s` command is in the following format:

```
<file_status> <file_name>
```

The `<file_status>` placeholder can be one of the following:

* `M`: The file has been modified.
* `A`: The file has been added.
* `D`: The file has been deleted.
* `R`: The file has been renamed.

Here is an example of the output of the `git status -s` command:

```
M   kim.js
M   main.txt
```

This output shows that two files have been modified since the last commit: `kim.js` and `main.txt`.

**Use of visual diff tools**

Visual diff tools can be used to compare two versions of a file and see the changes that have been made. This can be helpful for understanding what changes have been made to a file, especially if the changes are complex.

There are many different visual diff tools available, both free and commercial. Some popular visual diff tools include:

* Meld
* KDiff3
* Beyond Compare

To use a visual diff tool to compare two versions of a file, you would typically start by opening the two versions of the file in the diff tool. The diff tool will then show you the changes that have been made to the file.

Visual diff tools can be a valuable tool for understanding and reviewing code changes. They can also be helpful for resolving merge conflicts.
