**git diff --staged**

The `git diff --staged` command shows the differences between the files in the staging area and the latest commit. This command is typically used to review what changes are staged for the next commit [Source 13](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/git-diff).

**Usage**

```shell
git diff --staged
```

**Output Format**

The output of `git diff --staged` is in the unified diff format. It shows the changes made in each file, with lines added shown with a `+` and lines removed shown with a `-`. The `---` line shows the state of the file in the last commit, and the `+++` line shows the state of the file in the staging area.

Here is an example of the output:

```shell
diff --git a/main.txt b/main.txt
index 479c6bc..40fc635 100644
--- a/main.txt
+++ b/main.txt
@@ -1 +1,2 @@
-hello George Gacau
\ No newline at end of file
+hello George Gacau and Eliud
+Go back to schools 
\ No newline at end of file
```

In this example, the line "hello George Gacau" was removed (as indicated by `-`), and two new lines "hello George Gacau and Eliud" and "Go back to schools" were added (as indicated by `+`).

**Visual Diff Tools**

Git also supports visual diff tools for viewing changes. You can configure Git to use a visual tool for diff by setting the `diff.tool` configuration option. Many visual diff tools are supported, such as opendiff, kdiff3, meld, vimdiff, and others. You can use these tools with the `git difftool` command [Source 15](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration).

For example, to use vimdiff as your diff tool, you would run:

```shell
git config --global diff.tool vimdiff
```

Then you can view diffs using vimdiff with:

```shell
git difftool
```

In addition, various IDEs like Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio also provide built-in support for visualizing diffs [Source 26](https://www.roboleary.net/vscode/2020/09/15/vscode-git.html), [Source 20](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/version-control/git-with-visual-studio?view=vs-2022).
