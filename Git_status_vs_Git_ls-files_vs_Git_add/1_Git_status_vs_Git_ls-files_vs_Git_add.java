Let's clarify the functions of `git status`, `git ls-files`, `git add`, and `git commit` in Git:

1. **`git status`**:
   - `git status` is a Git command that reveals the current state of your working directory and staging area.
   - It shows you which files have been modified, added, or deleted in your working directory.
   - It also displays files that are staged (added to the staging area) and ready to be committed.
   - Additionally, `git status` may provide information about branches, untracked files, and the difference between your working directory and the last commit.

2. **`git ls-files`**:
   - `git ls-files` is a Git command that lists files in the Git index (staging area) along with their status.
   - It shows the files that are currently staged and ready for the next commit.
   - You can use options like `-s` to display the status of each file in a short format.

3. **`git add`**:
   - `git add` is used to stage changes from your working directory to the staging area. It prepares files for the next commit.
   - When you use `git add`, it doesn't remove files from the status or working directory; instead, it adds or updates them in the staging area.
   - You can add specific files or directories using `git add`.

4. **`git commit`**:
   - `git commit` creates a new snapshot (commit) of your project using the changes that are currently staged in the staging area.
   - It does not remove files from the staging area; instead, it captures the staged changes as a new commit.
   - After committing, the staging area remains as is, so you can continue to add and stage further changes for the next commit.

When you edit, delete, or add files, you typically do these operations in the working directory. Here's a typical workflow:

- **Edit Files**: You edit files in the working directory.

- **Add Files**: You use `git add` to stage specific changes or files that you want to include in the next commit. Staging is a way of selecting which changes you want to include in your commit.

- **Commit Files**: You use `git commit` to create a snapshot of the project using the changes that are currently staged in the staging area. The staging area is not cleared; it's ready for the next set of changes to be staged and committed.

To summarize, `git status` and `git ls-files` help you inspect the status of your files in the working directory and staging area, respectively. `git add` stages changes for the next commit, and `git commit` captures those staged changes into a new snapshot without removing them from the staging area.

   **git status**

The `git status` command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It shows which changes have been staged, which haven’t, and which files aren’t being tracked by Git. It does not show any information regarding the committed project history. The `git status` command is typically used to check which files have changes that are ready to be committed [Source 1](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/inspecting-a-repository), [Source 10](https://www.w3docs.com/learn-git/git-status.html).

**Usage**

```shell
git status
```

**git ls-files**

The `git ls-files` command shows information about files in the index and the working tree. It merges the file listing in the index with the actual working directory list, and shows different combinations of the two. This command can be useful to see which files are currently being tracked by Git [Source 4](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-ls-files).

**Usage**

```shell
git ls-files
```

**git add**

The `git add` command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area. It tells Git that you want to include updates to a particular file in the next commit. However, `git add` doesn't really affect the repository in any significant way—changes are not actually recorded until you run `git commit`. The `git add` command is used to stage changes for the next commit [Source 12](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes).

**Usage**

```shell
git add <file or directory>
```

**git commit**

The `git commit` command captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes. Committed snapshots can be thought of as “safe” versions of a project—Git will never change them unless you explicitly ask it to. The `git commit` command is used to save the staged changes to the repository [Source 9](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/git-commit).

**Usage**

```shell
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

**How Git Handles Changes**

When you edit, delete, or add files in your working directory, these changes are not immediately included in your repository. You need to tell Git which changes you want to include in the next commit. You do this by staging the changes with the `git add` command. Staged changes are changes that are ready to be committed to the repository. When you run `git commit`, Git takes all the changes that have been staged, creates a new commit object, and updates the repository to include the new commit [Source 9](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/git-commit) [Source 12](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes).

   **git status** reveals the state of your Git repository. It tells you which files are in the working directory, which files are in the staging area, and which files are uncommitted.

**git ls-files** reveals the files in the staging area. It is a list of all of the files that will be included in the next commit.

**git add** adds files from the working directory to the staging area. This does not remove the files from the working directory. Instead, it simply marks them for inclusion in the next commit.

**git commit** creates a snapshot of the files in the staging area and stores it in the Git repository. This removes the files from the staging area but does not remove them from the working directory.

**When you edit, delete, or remove files, you do it to the working directory.** The staging area and the snapshot version of the project are not affected until you run the `git add` command.

Here is an example:

```
# Initialize a new Git repository
git init

# Create a new file called README.md
echo "This is the README.md file." > README.md

# Add the README.md file to the staging area
git add README.md

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Add README.md file"

# Make some changes to the README.md file
echo "This is an updated version of the README.md file." > README.md

# The README.md file is now in the working directory but not in the staging area.

# To add the modified README.md file to the staging area, you would run the following command:
git add README.md

# To commit the changes, you would run the following command:
git commit -m "Update README.md file"
```

Now you have two commits in your Git repository. The first commit is a snapshot of your project when you first created it. The second commit is a snapshot of your project after you made changes to the README.md file.

Git is a powerful tool that can help you to track the changes to your project and manage your project history. I hope this helps!
