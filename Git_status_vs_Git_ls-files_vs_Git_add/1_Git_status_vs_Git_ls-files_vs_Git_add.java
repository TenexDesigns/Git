Let's clarify the functions of `git status`, `git ls-files`, `git add`, and `git commit` in Git:

1. **`git status`**:
   - `git status` is a Git command that reveals the current state of your working directory and staging area.
   - It shows you which files have been modified, added, or deleted in your working directory.
   - It also displays files that are staged (added to the staging area) and ready to be committed.
   - Additionally, `git status` may provide information about branches, untracked files, and the difference between your working directory and the last commit.

2. **`git ls-files`**:
   - `git ls-files` is a Git command that lists files in the Git index (staging area) along with their status.
   - It shows the files that are currently staged and ready for the next commit.
   - You can use options like `-s` to display the status of each file in a short format.

3. **`git add`**:
   - `git add` is used to stage changes from your working directory to the staging area. It prepares files for the next commit.
   - When you use `git add`, it doesn't remove files from the status or working directory; instead, it adds or updates them in the staging area.
   - You can add specific files or directories using `git add`.

4. **`git commit`**:
   - `git commit` creates a new snapshot (commit) of your project using the changes that are currently staged in the staging area.
   - It does not remove files from the staging area; instead, it captures the staged changes as a new commit.
   - After committing, the staging area remains as is, so you can continue to add and stage further changes for the next commit.

When you edit, delete, or add files, you typically do these operations in the working directory. Here's a typical workflow:

- **Edit Files**: You edit files in the working directory.

- **Add Files**: You use `git add` to stage specific changes or files that you want to include in the next commit. Staging is a way of selecting which changes you want to include in your commit.

- **Commit Files**: You use `git commit` to create a snapshot of the project using the changes that are currently staged in the staging area. The staging area is not cleared; it's ready for the next set of changes to be staged and committed.

To summarize, `git status` and `git ls-files` help you inspect the status of your files in the working directory and staging area, respectively. `git add` stages changes for the next commit, and `git commit` captures those staged changes into a new snapshot without removing them from the staging area.
