  git show

The git show command shows the changes made in a commit. By default, it shows the commit message and the differences introduced in the commit (i.e., what was added or removed to make this commit different from the previous one) git-scm.com.

Usage

git show <commit hash>
You can also use git show to view the contents of a specific file or directory at the time of a specific commit. To do this, you use the commit hash followed by a colon and the path to the file or directory. For example, git show 0970c64:.gitignore will show the contents of the .gitignore file as it was in commit 0970c64 git-scm.com.

git show <commit hash>:<path>

git show shows the contents of a Git object. It can be used to show the contents of a commit, a blob, a tree, or a tag.

The basic syntax for the git show command is as follows:

git show <object_hash>
The <object_hash> placeholder is the SHA-1 hash of the object that you want to view.

For example, to view the contents of the commit with the SHA-1 hash 0970c64, you would use the following command:

git show 0970c64
If the object is a blob, git show will display the contents of the file. If the object is a tree, git show will display a list of the files and directories in the tree. If the object is a tag, git show will display the commit that the tag points to.
# Show the commits that have been made by the user with the email address john.doe@example.com:
git log --author="John Doe <john.doe@example.com>"
