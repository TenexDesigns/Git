git ls-tree:

git ls-tree <commit_hash> displays the contents of a tree object associated with a specific commit.
It shows the file names, modes (permissions), types (blob or tree), and SHA-1 hashes of the objects in the tree.
Example command:

bash
Copy code
git ls-tree 0970c64   # Display the contents of a tree object in a specific commit
Git Objects:

Commit: Represents a snapshot of the project at a specific point in time. Commits link to a tree object representing the top-level directory structure.

Blob: Represents a file's content. Blobs are stored as objects in Git's object database and are identified by their SHA-1 hashes.

Tree: Represents a directory's content and structure. A tree object points to blobs (files) and sub-tree objects (subdirectories).

Tag: Represents a named reference to a specific commit, often used to mark important points in the history.

The output of these commands is typically presented in a structured format with relevant details such as commit hashes, author names, timestamps, and commit messages. You can use these commands to explore the history and content of your Git repository and gain insights into your project's development timeline and file changes.
