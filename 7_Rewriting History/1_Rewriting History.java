Rewriting history in Git involves changing existing commits in some way. This can be useful for making your commit history cleaner and easier to understand. Here are the key concepts and commands related to rewriting history in Git.

**Why Rewrite History**

Rewriting history in Git can make your commit history cleaner and easier to understand. This can be useful when working with other developers, as it can make it easier for them to understand the history of the project and the changes that have been made over time [Source 3](https://darekkay.com/blog/git-rewriting-history/).

**The Golden Rule of Rewriting History**

The golden rule of rewriting history is that you should never rewrite history that has been shared with others. Once you have pushed a commit, you should consider it as final. If you need to correct something in a commit that has been pushed, the best practice is to create a new commit to correct the mistake [Source 3](https://darekkay.com/blog/git-rewriting-history/).

**Undoing Commits**

The `git reset` command can be used to undo commits. This command moves the HEAD pointer to a previous commit, effectively "undoing" the commits that came after it.

```shell
git reset --hard <commit>
```

**Reverting Commits**

The `git revert` command creates a new commit that undoes the changes made in a specific commit.

```shell
git revert <commit>
```

**Recovering Lost Commits**

If you accidentally delete a commit, you can recover it using the `git reflog` command to find the SHA of the lost commit, and then the `git cherry-pick` command to apply the changes from the lost commit to the current branch.

```shell
git reflog
git cherry-pick <lost-commit>
```

**Amending the Last Commit**

The `git commit --amend` command can be used to modify the most recent commit. This can be useful if you made a mistake in your last commit and want to fix it without creating a new commit.

```shell
git commit --amend
```

**Amending an Earlier Commit**

If you need to modify an earlier commit, you can use the `git rebase -i` command to start an interactive rebase session, and then choose the "edit" option for the commit you want to amend.

```shell
git rebase -i <commit>^
```

**Dropping Commits**

If you want to remove a commit entirely, you can use the `git rebase -i` command to start an interactive rebase session, and then choose the "drop" option for the commit you want to remove.

```shell
git rebase -i <commit>^
```

**Rewording Commit Messages**

If you need to change the message of a commit, you can use the `git rebase -i` command to start an interactive rebase session, and then choose the "reword" option for the commit you want to reword.

```shell
git rebase -i <commit>^
```

**Reordering Commits**

If you want to change the order of commits, you can use the `git rebase -i` command to start an interactive rebase session, and then move the commits to their new positions in the list.

```shell
git rebase -i <commit>^
```

**Squashing Commits**

If you want to combine several commits into one, you can use the `git rebase -i` command to start an interactive rebase session, and then choose the "squash" option for the commits you want to squash.

```shell
git rebase -i <commit>^
```

**Splitting a Commit**

If you want to split a commit into several smaller commits, you can use the `git rebase -i`
