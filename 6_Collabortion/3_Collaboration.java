Collaboration in Git involves several concepts and commands that allow multiple people to work on a project without overwriting each other's changes. Here are the key concepts and commands related to collaboration in Git, along with some code examples.

**Creating a GitHub Repository**

You can create a new repository on GitHub to host your project. Once the repository is created, you can clone it to your local system using the `git clone` command:

```shell
git clone <repository-url>
```

**Adding Collaborators**

In GitHub, you can add collaborators to your repository via the repository settings. Collaborators have push access to the repository and can make changes [Source 0](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/practical-git-and-git-workflows/).

**Fetching, Pulling, and Pushing**

`git fetch` command is used to retrieve the latest changes from the remote repository without merging them into your local branch:

```shell
git fetch
```

`git pull` command is used to fetch the latest changes and merge them into your local branch:

```shell
git pull
```

`git push` command is used to push your local changes to the remote repository:

```shell
git push
```

**Sharing Branches**

You can push your local branches to the remote repository using the `git push` command. This allows others to access your branches and collaborate on them:

```shell
git push origin <branch-name>
```

**Collaboration Workflow**

A typical collaboration workflow involves creating a new branch for each feature or bug fix, making changes and committing them to the branch, and then merging the branch into the main branch once the work is complete [Source 1](https://dev.to/segolenealquier/mastering-git-step-by-step-collaborating-on-a-project-2b2p).

**Pull Requests**

In GitHub, you can create a pull request to propose changes. This allows others to review your changes before they are merged into the main branch [Source 8](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/data-science-process/collaborative-coding-with-git).

**Resolving Conflicts**

When multiple people are working on the same project, conflicts can occur. You can resolve conflicts manually by editing the conflicting files, marking them as resolved, and then committing the resolved changes:

```shell
# Edit files to resolve conflicts
git add <resolved-file>
git commit -m "Resolved conflict"
```

**Contributing to Open-source Projects**

You can contribute to open-source projects by forking the project's repository, creating a new branch, making changes, and then creating a pull request to propose your changes [Source 9](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows).
