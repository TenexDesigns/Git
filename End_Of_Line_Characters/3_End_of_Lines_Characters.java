The end-of-line character is a special character that indicates the end of a line of text. Different operating systems use different end-of-line characters. Windows uses the carriage return (CR) and line feed (LF) characters, while macOS and Linux use the LF character only.

The `core.autocrlf` setting controls how Git handles line endings. If it is set to `true`, Git will automatically convert line endings to CRLF when checking out files on Windows and to LF when checking out files on macOS and Linux. This helps to ensure that files are displayed correctly on all operating systems.

If `core.autocrlf` is set to `input`, Git will not automatically convert line endings. This is the recommended setting for macOS and Linux users, as it allows you to keep the original line endings of your files.

Here is an example of how to set the `core.autocrlf` setting for Windows and macOS:

```
# Windows
git config --global core.autocrlf true

# macOS
git config --global core.autocrlf input
```

The `core.autocrlf` setting is important because it helps to ensure that your files are displayed correctly on all operating systems. It also helps to prevent conflicts when merging branches that have been checked out on different operating systems.

Here are some additional benefits of using the correct `core.autocrlf` setting:

* It can help to prevent problems with text editors and other tools that are not compatible with different line endings.
* It can help to improve the readability of your code for other developers.
* It can help to avoid errors when committing your code to a remote repository.

I hope this helps!
