Yes, you can use the `rm` command to remove directories in a Unix-like or Linux operating system. To remove a directory, including all its contents (subdirectories and files), you can use the `rm` command with the `-r` (or `-rf`) option. Here's the syntax:

```bash
rm -r directory_name
```

Replace `directory_name` with the name of the directory you want to remove. Here's an example:

```bash
rm -r my_directory
```

Please exercise caution when using the `rm -r` command because it will permanently delete the specified directory and its contents, and there is typically no way to recover them. Make sure you have a backup or are confident that you want to delete the directory before running this command.
