Quiz  -- also, there are branches  and commits and snapshots , we make commits or incrememtal changes to branches, then when we finalize with a branche, we pull and merge it to the main branch,
  am I correct in my analisys

Your analysis is mostly correct, but let's clarify a few points:

1. **Branches:**
   - Branches are separate lines of development within a Git repository. They allow you to work on different features, bug fixes, or experiments independently. Each branch can contain a series of commits representing incremental changes to the code.

2. **Commits:**
   - Commits are snapshots of your project's files at a specific point in time. Commits capture changes made to the codebase, and each commit has a unique identifier. Commits are the building blocks of your Git history.

3. **Snapshots:**
   - In Git, when you make a commit, you're essentially creating a snapshot of the project's files at that moment. Commits are not just incremental changes but complete snapshots of the entire project directory at the time of the commit.

Here's how it all ties together:

- When you work in a branch, you make changes to the codebase incrementally by creating commits. Each commit represents a snapshot of the code at a particular state.

- As you work in the branch, you can make many commits, each building on the previous one.

- When you're done with the changes in a branch (e.g., you've completed a feature or fixed a bug), you can create a Pull Request (PR) to merge the branch into the main branch (or another target branch).

- Merging a branch into the main branch combines all the changes made in the branch into the main branch. It doesn't just pull the final result; it brings in all the commits and their snapshots.

So, in summary, branches are used to work on different features or tasks, and commits capture incremental changes within those branches. When a branch is ready, it can be merged into the main branch to incorporate all the changes and their associated snapshots into the main codebase. This allows you to maintain a clean and organized history of your project.
