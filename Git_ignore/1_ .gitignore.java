Ignoring Files:

To specify files or patterns that you want Git to ignore (e.g., build artifacts or configuration files), you can create a .gitignore file in the root of your Git repository and list the files or patterns you want to ignore. Here's an example .gitignore file:

plaintext
Copy code
# Ignore build artifacts
bin/
build/

# Ignore configuration files
config.ini

  Ignoring Files in Git

To ignore certain files in Git, you can create a .gitignore file in your repository's root directory. In this file, you can list all the files or directories that you want Git to ignore. These files will not be tracked by Git and will not appear in the list of untracked files when you run git status freecodecamp.org.

For example, to ignore all files in a directory named bin, you would add the following line to your .gitignore file:

bin/

  To ignore files, you can use the .gitignore file. The .gitignore file is a text file that contains a list of files and folders that Git should ignore.

To create a .gitignore file, create a new text file in the root directory of your Git repository and name it .gitignore. Then, add the files and folders that you want Git to ignore to the file.

For example, to ignore all of the .pyc files in your Git repository, you would add the following line to the .gitignore file:

*.pyc
