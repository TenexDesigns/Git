In Git, there are three levels of configuration settings,

  System - All users
  Global - All repositorys of the current user
  Local  - The current repository



  `git config` is a command in Git that allows you to configure various settings related to your Git environment. These settings can be specific to a particular project (local configuration) or applied globally to all your Git projects (global configuration). Here are explanations for the commands you mentioned:

1. `git config --global user.name "George"`:
   - This command sets your global Git username to "George." When you commit changes to a Git repository, Git associates your username with those commits.

2. `git config --global user.email georgetenex@gmail.com`:
   - This command sets your global Git email address to "georgetenex@gmail.com." Your email address is also associated with your commits and is used for identification.

3. `git config --global core.editor "code --wait"`:
   - This command sets your global Git text editor to "code --wait," which means Visual Studio Code will be used as the default text editor when you need to write commit messages or edit files during a Git operation.

4. `git config --global core.autocrlf true`: (for windows set it to true, for mac , set it to false )
   - This command configures how Git handles line endings. Setting `core.autocrlf` to "true" tells Git to automatically convert line endings to the appropriate format for your operating system when checking out files.

5. `git config --global -e`:
   - This command opens the global Git configuration file in your default text editor, allowing you to view and edit all your global Git settings.

Additional Git configuration commands you may find useful:

- `git config --list` or `git config -l`:
   - Lists all Git configuration settings, both global and local, for the current project.

- `git config --local` or `git config --system`:
   - These options allow you to configure settings at the local (project-specific) or system-wide level, respectively, rather than globally.

- `git config --unset <name>`:
   - Removes a specific Git configuration setting. Replace `<name>` with the name of the setting you want to remove.

- `git config --get <name>`:
   - Retrieves the value of a specific Git configuration setting. Replace `<name>` with the name of the setting you want to retrieve.

It's essential to understand Git configuration because it allows you to tailor Git to your preferences and adapt it to your development environment. You can set various options related to behavior, appearance, and interaction with other tools or services. Refer to the Git documentation or use `git help config` for a comprehensive list of configuration options and their descriptions.

  In Git, there are three levels of configuration settings, which you mentioned:

1. **System-Level Configuration (All Users)**:
   - This is the highest level of configuration and applies to all users on a given system or machine.
   - System-level configuration settings are typically defined in a configuration file that affects all Git repositories on the system.
   - These settings are usually managed by system administrators and are not specific to any particular user or repository.
   - The configuration file for system-level settings is often located in a system-wide configuration directory.

2. **Global-Level Configuration (All Repositories of the Current User)**:
   - Global-level configuration applies to all Git repositories owned by the current user on the machine.
   - These settings are personal to each user and can be used to define defaults for various Git configurations.
   - The configuration file for global-level settings is usually located in the user's home directory and is named `.gitconfig` (or `.config/git/config` on some systems).

3. **Local-Level Configuration (The Current Repository)**:
   - Local-level configuration settings are specific to the individual Git repository in which they are defined.
   - Each Git repository can have its own configuration settings that override global or system-level settings.
   - These settings are stored in the `.git/config` file within the repository directory.
   - Local-level configuration allows you to customize settings for a particular project without affecting other repositories or users.

The priority of these configuration levels is as follows: Local > Global > System. In other words, if you have a configuration setting defined at the local level, it will override any conflicting setting at the global or system level for that specific repository.

This hierarchical configuration approach allows users to have fine-grained control over Git's behavior at various levels, ensuring that each project can be configured to meet its specific requirements while still providing default settings at the global and system levels.
